# Remaining work ledger

Append-only unresolved-work ledger for GlyphMend upgrade prompts.

## Entry schema

Each unresolved item must use this schema:

```md
## GM-UPG-<unique-id> — <short title>
- Detected in step: <step number/name>
- Date:
- Status: OPEN | BLOCKED | DEFERRED | FAILED | RESOLVED
- Severity: critical | high | medium | low
- Area:
- Dependency:
- Description:
- Evidence:
- Files / symbols involved:
- What was attempted:
- Why it remains:
- Recommended next action:
- Safe to continue unrelated work: yes | no
- Resolution note:
```

Never delete old entries. Mark resolved work as `RESOLVED` and add a resolution note instead of removing history.
